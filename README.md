# Lokvyn

Lokvyn is a desktop GUI project initially focused on Ollama. This repository currently contains only an application shell: it does not connect to Ollama or list models yet. Support for other services is a future consideration, not an implemented feature.

## Development

The initial development environment is macOS. Other operating systems and distribution formats are not yet confirmed or validated. Install Node.js 24, Rust and the macOS prerequisites described in the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/), including Xcode Command Line Tools.

```sh
npm ci
npm run tauri dev
```

The desktop development command starts a local Vite server and opens the Tauri window. It does not require Ollama to be running.

## Checks

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --locked -- -D warnings
npm run tauri build
```

CI runs these checks on macOS. Bundling and release distribution are not configured yet. See [the architecture draft](docs/architecture.md) for outstanding decisions.
